                <h3>The New .zip Confusion</h3>
                <h4>The new .zip domain is ripe for phishing</h4>
                <p>Recently, Google launched a new TLD (Top Level 
Domain, which is the suffix of a web address or URL) called .zip and, 
it's already causing concern in the
		   cybersecurity community. An attacker could leverage this TLD, in 
combination with the @ operator and unicode character / to create an
                   extremely convincing phish for unsuspecting users. An
 URL usually contain a scheme (like http://), an hostname (like 
google.com), and sometimes
		   an userinfo section with a @ operator before the hostname (usually 
the username and password like username:password@). Everything between 
the scheme
                   https:// and the @ operator is treated as user info, 
and everything after the @ operator is immediately treated as a 
hostname. Modern broswers
                   would just uses the hostname if you click on a link 
containing the user info. But when you add slashes to the URL that comes
 before the @ operator,
                   such as https://google.com/search@bing.com, our 
browser will start to parse everything after the forward slash as the 
path, and now the bing.com
                   portion of the url will be ignored, and we will be 
taken to google.com. The problem here is a link containing a URL with a 
.zip domain and the @
	           operator after a forward slash might lead to a website that 
will automatically download malicious software into your computer if 
you're clicking on
                   a link to retrieve what is supposed to be a .zip 
file. For example, a credibleweb site with a download link to .zip file 
is usually like 
                   http://google.com/chrome/chrome.zip. A questionable 
website would have a link like 
http://google.com/chrome/alt/@randomfile.zip, which a browser
                   would interpret the URL as http://randomfile.zip. 
When looking at the URL or a web address, look for domains containing @ 
operators followed by .zip
                   or similar for future reference (like .exe or .msi) 
and always be careful about downloading files from URLs sent by unknown 
recipients, and hover over
                   URLs before clicking to see the expanded URL path.

                <h3>Personal Data of U.S. Government Employees Compromised</h3>
                <h4>Current and former government employees exposed in data breach</h4>
                <p>
                    Recently, the personal information of 237,000 
current and former federal government employees has been exposed in a 
data breach at the U.S.
                    Transportation Department (USDOT). The breach hit 
systems for processing TRANServe transit benefits that reimburse 
government employees for
                    some commuting costs. USDOT is currently 
investigating the breach and has frozen access to the transit benefit 
system until it has been secured and
                    restored. Governments are affected by hacking 
activites. The motivation of these attacks are usually monetary, 
political, recognition, or some
                    form of personal gain. Attacks like these cost 
taxpayers at least millions of dollars every year. Cybersecurity 
measures are usually up to par,
                    although the approriate implementation of these 
systems vary for each segment of a government. Attacks like these happen
 more often than you think and
                    will continue to happen as technology continues to 
advance.
